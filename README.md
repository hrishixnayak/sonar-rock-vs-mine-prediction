# Sonar Rock vs Mine Prediction 🎯

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on building a **Machine Learning classification model** to predict whether an object detected by sonar signals is a **Rock (R)** or a **Mine (M)**.

The dataset consists of sonar signal readings bounced off underwater objects. Each observation contains multiple numerical features representing energy levels at different frequencies.
